# React Basics Project

This is a simple React-based frontend website demonstrating the basics of React. It covers fundamental React concepts such as components, state, props, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional, if you prefer)

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-basics-project.git`

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   `cd react-basics-project`

3. **Install the project dependencies**:

   Using npm:

   `npm install`

   Or, if you are using yarn:

   `yarn install`

## Running the Project Locally

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project locally.

1. **Start the development server**:

   Using npm:

   `npm start`

   Or, if you are using yarn:

   `yarn start`

2. **Open your browser and navigate to**:

   `http://localhost:3000`

   You should now be able to see the React app running on your localhost.
